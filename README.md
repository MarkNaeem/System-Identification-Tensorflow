# system-Identification-Tensorflow
The Python code for "[Linear Time Invariant State Space System Identification Using Adam Optimization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9047808/)" paper with some examples on how to use it.


### There is two python files in this repository:
**SysIden.py:** includes the system identification class that builds the Tensorflow graph, takes the training data, and gives the optimized matrices.

**StateSpace.py:** Moved to [StateSpace-python](https://github.com/MarkNaeem/StateSpace-python).

**Examples.ipynb:**  The Ipython notebook shows examples about how to use the system identification class.
